# Security Policy
For security reasons, Pokemon 83 Premium has been blocked on edition mode (espacially for main users, not beta users). We also don't recommend to break the program while it's turning (do not press the [ON] button). In no case authors of the program will be responsible for problems of the calculator if any user violates the security policy.


## Supported Versions

TI-83 Premium CE / TI-84 Plus CE OS versions that are
currently being supported with this project (security updates):

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.0.1 | :grey_question: |
| 5.1.5 | :grey_question: |
| 5.2.1 | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.3.5 | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.4.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.5.1 - 5.5.2   | :x: |
| 5.6.1   | :x: |
| 5.7.0   | :x: |


Beware of OS > 5.5 !

Many programs, such as Oiram CE, Geometry CE and more are written in ASM/C or ICE.

However, due to an irresponsible act of a Mathematics teacher, Texas Instruments reacted by removing the management of such programs since the 5.5.1 update.

To know the version (OS) of your calculator, do the following:

	>> "2nd" then "+" then "1" (about); what is written below "TI-83 Premium CE" matches to the OS of your calculator.


If you are on one of the restricted versions, you can still execute these type of progams. Indeed, you will need to :

    >> install arTIfiCE to put back the possibility to launch ASM programs
    >> then preferably install Cesium to be able to launch ASM programs more easily, or even AsmHook to be able to launch them as before
    
A tutorial is available here (french) : https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=25252 

The latest OS of the TI-83 Premium CE / TI-84 Plus CE is 5.7.0.
